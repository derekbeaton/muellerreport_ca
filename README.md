Correspondence analyses of the Mueller Report
================

# Cleaning and preprocessing

For processing of the text, I did little additional work on top of two
analyses already performed:
[batpigandme/tidymueller](https://github.com/batpigandme/tidymueller)
and [cbail/mueller\_report](https://github.com/cbail/mueller_report). A
few extra cleaning steps were performed that align with [some of our
previous work on
NeuroSynth](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/157826v3), and that
code can be found in
[fahd09/neurosynth\_semantic\_map](https://github.com/fahd09/neurosynth_semantic_map).

# Basics of the analyses

In principle, these analyses are virtually the same as what we did for
the NeuroSynth database (see [our paper on correspondence analysis of
manuscript-by-terms in the NeuroSynth
database](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/157826v3) and
[fahd09/neurosynth\_semantic\_map](https://github.com/fahd09/neurosynth_semantic_map)).

A home for some correspondence analysis (CA) of the Mueller Report.

Updates forthcoming.
